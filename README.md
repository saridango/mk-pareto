#Pareto-Optimal Mario Kart Combinations for Different Tracks
This project explores Pareto-optimal kart setups in Mario Kart using the NSGA-II genetic algorithm, developed as part of CSCI 165: Bio-Inspired Machine Learning. By analyzing driver, vehicle, tire, and glider combinations, the system identifies optimal builds tailored to specific track types (e.g., long-straights, curvy, off-road).

Key features:
- Multi-objective optimization using speed, acceleration, mini-turbo, and handling stats
- NSGA-II implementation for evolutionary optimization
- Track-specific weighting to reflect diverse racing conditions
- Visualizations of Pareto fronts and UMAP-based clustering of setups
